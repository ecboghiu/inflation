"""Inflation
==================
Provides
 1. A tool for describing causal scenarios and reducing them to network form
    (see the definitions of network and non-network causal scenarios in
    arXiv:1707.06476 and arXiv:1909.10519).
 2. A tool for setting up and solving feasibility and optimization problems
    over probability distributions compatible with quantum causal scenarios.
