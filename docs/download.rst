Download and Installation
*************************

The package is available in the Python Package Index. The latest development version is available on GitHub.

Dependencies
============
The implementation requires `SymPy <http://sympy.org/>`_, `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and `Scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_. The code is only compatible with Python 3. It is recommended to install `Numba <http://www.numba.org/>`_ which provides just-in-time compilation of several core functions, yelding a significant speed-up.

Generated relaxations can be exported in `SDPA format <http://euler.nmt.edu/~brian/sdplib/FORMAT>`_, which can be loaded with other solvers. We also support the use of the `MOSEK <http://www.mosek.com/>`_ solver for efficiently solving the relaxation (MOSEK has free academic licenses). The MOSEK Python package needs to be installed. Future updates will include exporting to other solver interfaces, such as CVXPY, PICOS or YALMIP.

Installation
============
Follow the standard procedure for installing Python modules:

::

    $ pip install causalinflation

If you use the development version, you can download the source code from the `GitHub repository <>`_ and run

::
