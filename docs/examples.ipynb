    "LPI constraints were introduced in [Ref. [6]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16543). They are proportionality constraints between different entries of the moment matrix. Due to nature of the inflated graph, many of the moments in the moment matrix factorise into products of other moments. \n",

    "As a simplified example, consider the moment $\\langle A^{110}_{xa} B^{202}_{x'a'} B^{201}_{yb} \\rangle$ in the inflated triangle of order two. In the triangle, we have three sources, $\\rho_{AB}$, $\\rho_{AC}$ and $\\rho_{BC}$. The upper indices in the operators of the previous moment indicate on which copy of the sources the operator is acting. The value 0 means that the party does not measure the corresponding source. For example, $B^{201}_{yb}$ represents Bob measuring outcome $b$ of setting $y$ on copy 2 of $\\rho_{AB}$ and copy 1 of $\\rho_{BC}$. Notice that because of the non-overlapping support of some of the moments, the moment factorises as follows:\n",

Linear programming techniques allow one to build an oracle that can decide whether a given distribution is inside or outside a given polytope. See [[Sec. II, 7]](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.86.419) for more information. For many-body systems linear programming does not scale efficiently. The NPA hierarchy with all-to-all-commuting operators is an outer approximation of the linear programming method. In particular, the set of probability distributions which lead to a feasible all-commuting NPA SDP relaxation strictly includes the local set. However, given a sufficiently high level of the hierarchy, this set becomes exactly the local set, i.e., it converges to the local polytope. For intermediate levels of the hierarchy, the approximation is less tight, but it is more efficiently implementable than the linear program.\n",

    "### Example 10: The instrumental scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest causal scenario that exhibits a gap between classical, quantum and post-quantum correlations is the [instrumental scenario [8]](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2019-09-16-186/). In the instrumental scenario we have two parties, Alice and Bob, that share a common source of correlations. While Alice can choose between different measurement settings, $x$, Bob has no choice. However, Alice is allowed to signal her output to Bob. This is depicted as a DAG in Figure a) below. For correlations arising in a standard Bell experiment, one can post-select only those where Bob's input is the same as Alice's output, $p(a,b|x,y{=}a)$. The postselection introduces one-way signaling by correlating Bob's input with Alice's output, thus simulating the instrumental scenario. This is depicted in Figure b) below. Clearly then we can project a Bell-type correlation to an instrumental-type correlation. The reverse also holds, namely instrumental-type correlations can be lifted to Bell-type correlations. Due to this, if one can prove that certain correlations, when lifted to a network-type scenario, are incompatible with said scenario, it must also be the case that the unlifted correlations are incompatible with the base scenario.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <img src=\"./figures/instrumental.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"650\"/> </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated SDP relaxation for the instrumental scenario corresponds to that of the Bell scenario with the following modification: expectation values involving operators with a mismatch between Alice's output and Bob's input, $a\\neq y$, are left as free variables, and are not fixed when specifying a probability distribution. While in standard Bell scenarios we can fully use the so-called [Collins-Gisin notation [9]](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0306129), which has normalisation built-in by expressing moments in the moment matrix without using the last output, in beyond-network scenarios we need to explicitly include the last output when it serves as an input to another party (and add the corresponding normalisation constraints) as it cannot be rewritten in terms of other variables. This is all done automatically by the package. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the lifted scenario, the input cardinality of children (those that are on the receiving end of one-way signalling influences) increases to accomodate the different output values of the parent nodes. For the instrumental scenario, this means that Bob's input goes from $y$ in the base scenario to $y'=(y,a)$ in the lifted scenario. The attribute `InflationProblem.effective_to_parent_settings` is a list of dictionaries which, for each party, unravels the effective setting in the lifted scenario to a tuple encoding the private setting and the parents' outputs. For example, in a network with parties Alice, Bob, Charlie and Dave, if Alice and Dave signal to Bob, then the effective setting $y'$ of Bob in the lifted scenario is $y'=(y,a,d)$ (or $y'=(y,d,a)$ if we specify specify a custom order with via the `order` optional parameter where Dave appears before Alice).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a specific application, we can show that the following distribution: \n",
    "$$p(a,b|x)= \\begin{cases}1 / 2 & \\text { if } b=a+f(x, a) \\quad \\bmod 2 \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "with $f(0,a)=0$, $f(1,a){=}a$, $f(2,a){=}a+1 \\bmod2$, is incompatible with the instrumental scenario with quantum sources of correlations with the following code:"

    "Hardy's paradox \"is the simplest form of Bell's theorem\". It is a proof without inequalities that certain correlations are incompatible with local realism based only on possibilistic arguments: it only assumes whether certain events are possible (positive probability) or impossible (zero probability) in order to reach a contradiction [[10]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1819). In the spirit of Hardy-type paradoxes, one can extend the quantum inflation technique to tackle compatibility of a possibilistic support with a given causal structure. Standard quantum inflation cannot handle support problems numerically because one cannot distinguish with floating point precision between $0$ and a number that is sufficiently close to zero. One approach to circumvent this problem is to scale the moment matrix by an appropriate positive factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an SDP relaxation testing compatibility that is feasible and let $\\Gamma^*$ be the optimal analytical solution. If we divide $\\Gamma^*$ by the smallest non-zero element of $\\Gamma^*$, $\\epsilon$, then moments that are identical to zero (e.g., those which involve impossible events) will be mapped to zero. However, all other moments will be mapped either to the interval $[1,\\infty)$ if they are positive moments, or to $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ if they can be negative. The expectation value of the identity will also be mapped to $[1,\\infty)$,  $\\langle 1 \\rangle \\to \\langle 1 \\rangle/\\epsilon$, and it will upper bound all other moments in the moment matrix. Notice that instead of finding the optimal solution of the original SDP and rescaling it, we can solve the rescaled SDP from the beginning. To get back the original moment matrix whose moments can be interpreted as probabilities, we can divide $\\Gamma^*/\\epsilon$ by the numerical value found for the identity moment, $\\langle 1 \\rangle^*/\\epsilon$. Given that this scaling is one to one, infeasibility of the rescaled SDP implies infeasibility for the original SDP and viceversa. Furthermore, in the rescaled SDP moments that are identically zero can be distinguished from non-zero moments, and as such, the rescaled SDP can be solved numerically.\n",
