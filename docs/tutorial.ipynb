    "### Basics of causal diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal relationships are encoded through a Bayesian Directed-Acyclic-Graph, or \"DAG\", for short. The nodes of the graph represent random variables, which can be either observable (visible) or unobservable (hidden). Directed arrows encode causal influence between nodes. Arrows point from parent nodes to the nodes causally influences by the parent, called children nodes. The acyclicity property avoids the presence of causal loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "For applications to physics, another class of random variables is often considered called \"settings\". These correspond to observable variables on whose outcome we condition in order to obtain the observed data. For example, this might correspond to measuring one property of a system versus another in an experiment. Furthermore, in physics we also have sources generating quantum correlations. These are modeled through the presence of quantum unobservable variables, which represent quantum system. Arrows going into a quantum node represent controlling the corresponding quantum system. Arrows going out of the quantum node represent the children of the quantum node generating statistics by measuring the quantum system.\n",

    "### The bilocal scenario and an inflation\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let us consider the quantum [\"bilocal scenario\"](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.85.032119), which corresponds to correlations achievable by measuring quantum particles that never interacted in the past. This is a simple scenario where [entanglement swapping](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.4287) can be performed, which is at the heart of the [quantum teleportation protocol](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.1895). The corresponding DAG is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/bilocal_1.PNG\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have three observed random variables, $A$, $B$ and $C$, two hidden quantum variables $\\rho_{AB}$ and $\\rho_{BC}$ denoting the particles and three setting variables, $X$, $Y$ and $Z$. We assume all observed variables have cardinality 2, i.e., $a,b,c,x,y,z \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where lower case denotes specific values the random variables (in upper case) can take. In this causal scenario, correlations are generated by measuring the quantum systems conditioned on the values of the settings. These correlations are encoded in the joint probability distribution $p(a,b,c|x,y,z)$. Notice that the probability distribution is not conditioned on $\\rho_{AB}, \\rho_{BC}$ as they are hidden variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental questions to ask if whether a given a probability distribution $p(a,b,c|x,y,z)$ is compatible with a given causal scenario. The challenge in answering this question comes from the assumption of statistical independence of the quantum sources $\\rho_{AB}$ and $\\rho_{BC}$. The quantum inflation technique is one technique that can give an answer to this question by relaxing the independence constraint. Let us consider an inflation of the bilocal scenario where we take two copies of each source, as in the following figure:\n",

    "\n",
    "Compatibility of the probability distribution with the inflated graph can be relaxed to a semidefinite program (SDP) using the NPA hierarcy. At the level of the SDP, the independence of the sources is relaxed to a collection of symmetries that can be applied to the SDP.
