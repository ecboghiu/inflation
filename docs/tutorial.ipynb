    "The CausalInflation package contains implementations of the inflation technique for causal compatibility. Currently it only supports the quantum inflation method of [[1](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1909.10519)]. In the future, we plan adding support to the inflation hierarchy for classical causal compatibility of [[2](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.00672)] and dedicated parts for analysing theory-independent correlations. The implementation of CausalInflation follows an object-oriented design. The workflow comprises of three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encode the causal scenario and desired inflation as an instance of `InflationProblem`.\n",
    "* Generate the associated optimization problem for classical, quantum, or theory-independent inflation (currently, only `InflationSDP` is available).\n",
    "* Export the problem to a file and/or solve it.\n",

    "We will now go through the steps above in more detail.

If already familiar with quantum inflation, the quickest way to get started is to run some examples from the [Examples](https://ecboghiu.github.io/inflation/_build/html/examples.html) section, which can also be downloaded as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ecboghiu/inflation/blob/main/docs/examples.ipynb).\n",

    "## Encoding the inflation problem \n",
    "\n",
    "The first object of interest is [`InflationProblem`](https://ecboghiu.github.io/inflation/_build/html/inflationproblem.html#causalinflation.InflationProblem). When instantiating it, we pass all the relevant information about the causal scenario and the type of inflation we want to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basics of causal diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal relationships are encoded through a Bayesian Directed Acyclic Graph, or DAG for short. The nodes of the graph represent random variables, which can be either observable (visible) or unobservable (hidden). Directed arrows encode causal influences between nodes. Arrows point from parent nodes to the nodes causally influenced by them, called children nodes. The acyclicity property avoids the presence of causal loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "For applications to physics, another class of random variables is often considered called \"settings\". These correspond to observable variables on whose outcome we condition in order to obtain the observed data. For example, this might correspond to measuring one property of a system versus another in an experiment. Furthermore, in physics we also have sources generating quantum correlations. These are modeled through the presence of quantum unobservable variables, which represent quantum systems. Arrows going into a quantum node represent controlling the corresponding quantum system. Arrows going out of the quantum node represent the children of the quantum node generating statistics by measuring the quantum system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The quantum tripartite line and an inflation\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let us consider the quantum tripartite line, or \"quantum bilocality scenario\" [[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4502)], which corresponds to the scenario where three space-like separated parties ($A$, $B$ and $C$) measure two quantum systems $\\rho_{AB}$, $\\rho_{BC}$ that never interacted in the past. The subindex of the quantum states indicates which parties have access to and can measure that state. This is a simple scenario where entanglement swapping [[4](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.4287)] can be performed, which is at the heart of the quantum teleportation protocol [[5](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.1895)]. The corresponding DAG is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <img src=\"./figures/bilocal.png\" width=\"400\" /> </center> \n",
    "\n",
    "We have three observed random variables, $A$, $B$ and $C$, two hidden quantum variables $\\rho_{AB}$ and $\\rho_{BC}$ of unbounded dimension denoting the physical systems sent to the parties, and three setting variables, $X$, $Y$ and $Z$. We assume all observed variables have cardinality 2, i.e., $a,b,c,x,y,z \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where lower case denotes specific values that the random variables (in upper case) can take. In this causal scenario, correlations are generated by measuring the quantum systems conditioned on the values of the settings. These correlations are encoded in the joint probability distribution $p(a,b,c|x,y,z)$. Notice that the probability distribution is not conditioned on $\\rho_{AB}$, $\\rho_{BC}$ as they are hidden variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantum causal compatibility and an inflation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental questions to ask is whether a given a probability distribution $p(a,b,c|x,y,z)$ is compatible with a given causal scenario. The challenge in answering this question comes from the assumption of statistical independence of the quantum sources $\\rho_{AB}$ and $\\rho_{BC}$. The quantum inflation technique is one technique that can give an answer to this question by relaxing the independence constraint. Let us consider an inflation of the bilocal scenario where we take two copies of each source, as in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>  <img src=\"./figures/bilocalityinflation.png\" width=\"400\" /> </center> \n",
    "\n",
    "Compatibility of the probability distribution with the inflated graph can be relaxed to a semidefinite program (SDP) using the NPA hierarchy [[6](https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4290). The independence of the sources is relaxed to a collection of symmetries that can be applied to the SDP. These symmetries arise from the extra sources in the inflated graph being copies of the original sources, e.g., $\\rho_{AB}{=}\\rho_{AB}^1{=}\\rho_{AB}^2$. If the SDP is infeasible, then we can conclude that the distribution $p(a,b,c|x,y,z)$ is incompatible with this causal graph, and furthermore, we get an analytical certificate. For more details, see [[1](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1909.10519)]. \n",

    "### Creating an instance of `InflationProblem`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in using CausalInflation is encoding the scenario to be analyzed. This is done by providing a description of the target DAG, as well as the cardinalities of its visible variables (and optionally a number of possible measurement settings for each one). Also, one must specify the inflation that shall be constructed, by providing the amount of copies of each of the latent variables in the DAG that the inflation will contain. All this information is passed to an instance of `InflationProblem` as follows:"
